            <p>The Goal was an interesting book. The spin by the author to write a fictional story was cool and reminded me of being a kid. I don't remember the last time I read a fictional book. Another interesting spin was the author's focus on the main character's (Alex Rogo) struggle to balance his work stress with his home stress. His world is literally crumbling beneath him but he stays the course. His resiliency is rewarded in the end. It was just a nice reminder that we are all human and we all have to overcome obstacles with our jobs and our families.</p>
            <p>Alex works in a manufacturing plant as the plant manager, back in his hometown. His plant is about to be closed because he can't ship anything on time. Alex's mentor, Jonah, helps him see his current processes in a new light by using the ol Socratic method.</p>
            <p>Much of the <b>"Theory of Constraints"</b> is a common sense approach to problem solving but at this stage of my life, I appreciate approaches that are scientific as opposed other methods.</p>
            <p>"TOC" is a five step process that can be used to manage manufacturing bottlenecks. The three key measurements for TOC are <b>throughput, operational expense,</b> and <b>inventory</b>. TOC is a great reminder that inventory is an expense and only when it is processed to throughput by sales does it move over to revenue.</p>
            <p>Out of the five management books I have read, each and every one discuss Toyota. Industrial engineer, Taiichi Ohno, helped Toyota develop the <b>Kanban</b> system of manufacturing. Toyota has <b>"Just In Time"</b> down to a science. Much of this practice is based on releasing the right amount of inventory at the right time to manage "work in progress" inventory. Toyota was actually inspired by supermarkets and how they manage inventory to keep food fresh. Kanban focuses on the "pull" of inventory based on demand.</p>
            <p>So what does all this mean? Constraints are almost always machines/(software systems) or people. Software is not entirely different than a manufacturing plant but there does seem to be one glaring difference. Stability in the system. Automobile manufacturing has a very structured process. You build a Toyota Tundra nearly the same exact way each time, minus a part or two and color. At Favish, we are building unique one-off websites and interfaces. The unpredictable nature of our business can make the process a bit muddied. Never the less, managing around your constraints can be a tricky dance.</p>
            <p>From a Project Management point of view, software development often requires <b>Agile</b> methodologies where Toyota can rely on the <b>Waterfall</b> method.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah...and the "Goal" is always to make money.</p>
